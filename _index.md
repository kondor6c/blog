full for full featured content, this will be for living documents that I will try to maintain. My SSL/TLS article will be here as will others like the document describing my dotfiles.

I am Kevin, a "devops" "sysadmin" who really enjoy's "engineering".
I try to document difficult points in technology. I'm mostly self taught, I have met very interesting and cool people along the way and I really like hanging out with them still.
