Resume, pictures, information about my family and me

Myself
------
I enjoy mountain biking, although since I have moved from Arizona I haven't done it. Instead I've been road biking, mostly for fitness.


Resume
######
Here is my resume of my professional experiance and skills, I really don't enjoy writing this it feels like I'm bragging, I therefore try to be humble because I know there are many others out there that are more knowledgable than I am.

Photos
######
I have a picture on my github account, but I figured I'd put some here too.

GPG Key
#######
My public GPG key can be found on keyservers and keybase. My email addresses can be found as the identities there. If you send me an encrypted or signed message, I will make it a priority to respond to you. This is because someone took the time to have a generate a key and is more than likely a real person. I have it tied to a GPG SmartCard, I would recommend doing that if you have time.
