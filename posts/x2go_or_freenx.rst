x2go or freenx
==============

I have had the worst time with x2go both on Fedora and Ubuntu, I thought neatx from Google was the preferred method for doing remote sessions but I heard that had changed. x2go doesn't even offer a Windows client like NoMachine offers. I was trying to test libpng on a scaleway Fedora 22 ARM server (https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2015-6c07ab1fa6). I guess I'll have to find another way of doing that.
